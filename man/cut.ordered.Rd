\title{Create Bins for ordered Factors}
\usage{
\method{cut}{ordered}(x, breaks, labels = NULL, include.lowest = TRUE,
  right = TRUE, ordered_result = TRUE, label_sep = "-", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector which is to be converted to a factor by cutting.}

\item{breaks}{Either a numeric vector of two or more unique cut points or a 
 single number (greater than or equal to 2) giving the
number of intervals into which \code{x} is to be cut.}

\item{labels}{Labels for the levels of the resulting category. By default, 
labels are constructed using \code{a-b, c-d} interval notation.
If \code{labels = FALSE}, simple integer codes are returned instead of a 
factor.}

\item{include.lowest}{Logical, indicating if an \code{x[i]} equal to the 
lowest (or highest, for \code{right = FALSE}) breaks value should be 
included.}

\item{right}{Logical, indicating how to create the bins. This is utilized in
two different ways based on the type of breaks argument. In the
conventional case, where a breaks vector is supplied, \code{right = TRUE}
indicates that bins should be closed on the right (and open on the left) or
vice versa. If a single integer breaks value is provided, then 
\code{right = TRUE} indicates that bins will be determined such that those 
on the right are larger (if it is not possible for all bins to be evenly 
sized).}

\item{ordered_result}{Logical: should the result be an ordered factor? Note 
that since the input data is ordered this argument is \code{TRUE} by 
default.}

\item{label_sep}{A single or short character string used to generate labels 
for the intervals e.g. the default value of "-" will result in labels like 
a-c d-g i-z etc.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to or from other methods, 
in particular to \code{\link{cut.default}}.}
}
\value{
A factor is returned, unless \code{labels = FALSE} which results in 
 an integer vector of level codes.
}
\description{
cut divides the range of \code{x} into intervals and codes the values in 
 \code{x} according to the interval they fall into.
}
\details{
In deviation from \code{cut.default}, \code{cut.ordered} does not 
 have an argument \code{dig.lab}, but instead has an argument that does not 
 exist for \code{cut.default}: \code{label_sep}.
 Note that unlike \code{\link[base]{cut.default}}, here 
 \code{include.lowest} defaults to \code{TRUE}, since this is more intuitive 
 for integer intervals.

\examples{
 some_letters <- cfactor(sample(letters, 100, replace = TRUE), ordered = TRUE)
 head(cut(some_letters, breaks = c("a", "q", "z"), 
          labels = c("beginning of the alphabet", "the rest of the alphabet"), 
          right = TRUE, include.lowest = TRUE))
}
