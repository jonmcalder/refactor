# refactor

>refactor is an R package which hopes to provide better handling of factors by attempting to address some of the known problems and short-comings present in R   
>(e.g. as outlined in this [Win-Vector blog post](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/09/factors-are-not-first-class-citizens-in-r/))

## Installation

refactor is not available on CRAN but you can easily install the latest version from github using `devtools`:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jonmcalder/refactor")
```

## Overview

Below are some of the highlights.  


#### Better factor creation:  
  
- sequences in strings are detected and used to order the factor levels automatically
    - e.g. EUR11-20, EUR51-EUR60, EUR101-EUR110  
    
- get warnings whenever provided factor levels don't fully match those present in the data  


#### Extension of the generic `cut` method to handle (discrete) integer data:  
  
- generate 'natural' intervals for factors when using cut on integer vectors 
    - e.g. `[1,3], [4,6], [7,9]` as opposed to `(0.5, 3.5], (3.5, 6.5], (6.5, 9.5]`  
    
- label factor levels more intuitively 
    - e.g. `1-3, 4-6, 7-9` as opposed to `[1,3], [4,6], [7,9], or (0,3], (3,6], (6-9]`
